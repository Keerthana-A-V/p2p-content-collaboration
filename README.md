# p2p-content-collaboration
A p2p shared content collaboration platform using FLO Blockchain. 

To use the application just download the HTML file and run it in any browser. 

To add/edit contents click in the respective division and add/edit your content. When you focus out
of the division the content is added into the system. Content can only be added or modified.

Any user running the file gets to edit a shared content. Hence, this application can be used for multiple purposes
like create shared content, write book by multiple authors or reach a consensus through collaborative discussion.

Please fork the project and contribute.
